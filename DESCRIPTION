Description: The package provides an adaptive independence test for multinomial/
    Dirichlet-multinomial distributed microbiome data. We propose a parametric test 
    based on likelihood ratio test. The basic idea is to partition the range of the 
    outcome variable into a few slices or bins, then test whether the community 
    distributions are equal across the slices. Our method regularizes the log 
    likelihood ratio with a penalty on the number of slices, and maximizes over 
    all possible slicing schemes.
